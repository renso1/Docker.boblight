# Boblight with BlinkStick support

This is Boblight repository with BlinkStick support based on [Boblight](https://code.google.com/p/boblight/) source code.
This source code compiles on Linux, OSX and Windows.

BlinkStick is a smart USB-Controlled LED Pixel. More information about it here:

http://www.blinkstick.com

## Changes from official source code

* Build environment cleanup
* Full support for Windows build environment under [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)
* BlinkStick support under Linux and OSX with libusb
* BlinkStick support under Windows without extra drivers using native Windows HID API

## Build

### Linux

**NOTE:** The instructions below for Linux are incompete. Please follow this [comprehensive guide
to set up BlinkStick with Kodi/XBMC on Linux OS](https://forums.blinkstick.com/t/blinkstick-ambilight-with-kodi-xbmc-and-boblight-on-linux-os/132/1).

Prepare the build environment

	sudo apt-get install -y build-essential autoconf libtool libusb-1.0-0-dev portaudio19-dev git 

Clone this repository

	git clone http://github.com/arvydas/boblight

Change directory

    cd boblight
	
Run the following commands to set up build environment and build boblight

	./autogen.sh
	./configure --without-x11 --prefix=/usr
	make
	
Set up your configuration file as described in the [Boblight wiki](https://code.google.com/p/boblight/wiki/boblightconf). 
Sample configuration files for BlinkStick are available in the ./conf subdirectory of the source code repository.

Run boblightd by issuing the following command

	./src/boblightd

Alternatively you can supply your own config file manually, for example

	./src/boblightd -c ./conf/blinkstick.conf

If you get permission problems that access to BlinkStick is denied, please run the following command:

	echo "SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"20a0\", ATTR{idProduct}==\"41e5\", MODE:=\"0666\"" | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/85-blinkstick.rules

Alternatively you can run boblightd with sudo.

If you want to install boblight to your system run the following command:

	sudo make install

Then follow the guide in the Wiki to [automatically start boblightd](https://github.com/arvydas/boblight/wiki/Automatically-starting-boblightd-on-Linux) when OS starts.

### OSX

Prepare the build environment

	brew install autoconf automake libtool libusb git

Clone this repository

	git clone http://github.com/arvydas/boblight

Change directory

  cd boblight
	
Run the following commands to set up build environment and build boblight

	./autogen.sh
	./configure --without-x11 --without-portaudio
	make
	
Set up your configuration file as described in the [Boblight wiki](https://code.google.com/p/boblight/wiki/boblightconf). 
Sample configuration files for BlinkStick are available in the ./conf subdirectory of the source code repository.

	./src/boblightd

Alternatively you can supply your own config file manually, for example

	./src/boblightd -c ./conf/blinkstick.conf

### Windows

Building under Windows requires Cygwin environment. Prepare it by installing [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) together with the following additional packages

* make
* autoconf
* automake
* libtool
* gcc-g++
* libusb1.0-devel
* git

Open Cygwin shell and clone this repository

	git clone http://github.com/arvydas/boblight

Change directory

    cd boblight
	
Run the following commands to set up build environment and build boblight

	./autogen.sh
	./configure --without-portaudio --without-x11
	make

Set up your configuration file as described in the [Boblight wiki](https://code.google.com/p/boblight/wiki/boblightconf). 
Sample configuration files for BlinkStick are available in the ./conf subdirectory of the source code repository.

You can run boblightd.exe from the Cygwin environment by executing the following command

	./src/boblightd.exe

Alternatively you can supply your own config file manually, for example

	./src/boblightd.exe -c ./conf/blinkstick.conf

If you want to run Boblightd.exe as standalone application without Cygwin environment, you will need the following files

	./src/.libs/boblightd.exe
	/bin/cyggcc_s-1.dll
	/bin/cygstdc++-6.dll
	/bin/cygusb-1.0.dll
	/bin/cygwin1.dll
